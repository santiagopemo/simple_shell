## Description
In this project we are tasked with creating our own simple UNIX command interpreter that executes commands from the standard input or from a file.

---
## Instructions:bulb:

- Compiling the program: ```sh gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh ```
- Interactive mode:
```sh
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```
- Non-interactive mode:
```sh
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```
